# Tyler_Gilbert-Activity15-Repo
I have created a repo file and have included a README file, and I have inlcuded Activity #14, the PDF for activity 14, and the QMD file for the previous activity.
The purpose of this activity is to learn the ins and outs of GitHub working on workflows, README files, issues, using more than one branch and version control.
